# Security Policy

## Supply Chain Security

### NPM Package Verification Process

WebSSH2 Client implements comprehensive security measures to protect against supply chain attacks, including the NPM package hijacking incident reported in September 2025.

#### Verification Status
âœ… **VERIFIED SAFE** - This repository does not contain compromised packages from the September 2025 NPM supply chain attack.

#### Enhanced Security Measures

##### 1. Package Cool-Down Period
- **Policy**: 2-week quarantine for all newly released package versions
- **Process**: New versions only adopted after community vetting period  
- **Build Tools**: Special attention to Vite plugins and build dependencies
- **Exception**: Critical security patches with CVE advisories

##### 2. Automated Security Scanning
```bash
# Run security checks
npm run security:check     # Check for compromised packages
npm run security:audit     # Run npm audit + recommend Trivy
npm run security:socket    # Instructions for Socket.dev scan
```

##### 3. Client-Specific Security
- **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy validation for built assets
- **SRI Hash Generation**: Subresource Integrity for distributed files
- **No Dynamic Loading**: Static dependency analysis only
- **Minimal Runtime**: Reduced client-side dependencies

##### 4. Build Pipeline Security
- Pre-build dependency verification
- Post-build artifact scanning with Trivy
- Bundle analysis for security review
- Release-please integration with security checks

#### Locked Package Versions
The following packages are locked to safe versions via `overrides`:
```json
{
  "debug": "4.4.1"
}
```

### Build Security Process

#### Development Environment
1. **Dependency Verification**: All build tools verified before use
2. **Vite Configuration**: Security-focused build settings
3. **Hot Module Replacement**: Secure local development only

#### Production Builds
1. **Artifact Scanning**: Trivy scan of final bundle
2. **Integrity Verification**: SRI hashes for all assets  
3. **CSP Validation**: Content Security Policy compliance
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Security review of dependencies in final bundle

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Please report security vulnerabilities to:
- **Email**: security@webssh2.com (if available)
- **GitHub**: Create a private security advisory
- **Emergency**: Create a public issue with `security` label

### Security Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Within 1 week for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have time to update

### Security Best Practices for Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Pin dependency versions** - Avoid automatic updates
3. **Review build tool updates** - Wait 2 weeks for new releases
4. **Run security checks** - Before every commit
5. **Verify bundle integrity** - Check final build outputs

### Dependency Management Policy

#### New Dependencies
1. Community vetting period (2 weeks minimum)
2. Security audit with Socket.dev and Trivy
3. Build tool compatibility verification
4. Client-side security impact assessment
5. Approval by security team

#### Updates
1. Review change logs for security implications
2. Wait 2 weeks after release (except security patches)
3. Test in isolated build environment
4. Verify final bundle security before merging

### Security Tools Integration

#### Socket.dev
```bash
# Install Socket.dev CLI
npm install -g @socketsecurity/cli
# Scan project with strict settings
socket.dev cli scan --strict
```

#### Trivy
```bash
# Install Trivy (macOS)
brew install trivy
# Scan all files including build output
trivy fs --security-checks vuln .
```

#### Vite Security
```bash
# Build with security analysis
npm run build
# Analyze bundle for security issues
npm run analyze
```
